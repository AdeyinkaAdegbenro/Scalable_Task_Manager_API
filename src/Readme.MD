Since you‚Äôre a backend-focused engineer, let‚Äôs pick a project that highlights your API design, database skills, and performance optimizations. Here‚Äôs an idea:

Project: Scalable Task Manager API

A simple but well-structured API for creating, updating, and tracking tasks, showcasing:
‚úÖ Authentication & User Management (JWT or OAuth)
‚úÖ CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
‚úÖ Database Optimization (PostgreSQL with indexes for performance)
‚úÖ Background Jobs (e.g., Celery or Task Queues for sending reminders)
‚úÖ Containerization & CI/CD (Docker + GitHub Actions)

Tech Stack:
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Flask (or FastAPI) / Django REST Framework
	‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQL (or MySQL)
	‚Ä¢	Authentication: JWT (using PyJWT)
	‚Ä¢	Background Processing: Celery + Redis (for task scheduling)
	‚Ä¢	Deployment (Optional): Docker + GitHub Actions + Render/Heroku

Features to Build in Phases:

Phase 1: Basic CRUD API
	‚Ä¢	Users can create, update, delete, and list tasks
	‚Ä¢	Each task has a title, description, priority, and due date
	‚Ä¢	Store tasks in PostgreSQL with proper indexing

Phase 2: Authentication & User Accounts
	‚Ä¢	User registration and login (JWT authentication)
	‚Ä¢	Each user sees only their own tasks

Phase 3: Background Jobs & Performance Tweaks
	‚Ä¢	Auto-send reminders for overdue tasks using Celery + Redis
	‚Ä¢	Implement caching (Redis) for faster task retrieval
	‚Ä¢	Optimize database queries and measure response times

Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation
	‚Ä¢	Dockerize the project
	‚Ä¢	Add Postman Collection & API Docs (Swagger/OpenAPI)
	‚Ä¢	Deploy to Render, Heroku, or AWS

Why This Project?

‚úÖ Shows you can build, optimize, and deploy APIs‚Äîa key skill for senior engineers
‚úÖ Covers database design, authentication, background jobs, and performance tuning
‚úÖ If done well, it can be a great portfolio project and even attract open-source contributors

Would you like a detailed roadmap or sample repo structure to help you get started?

For a senior developer who‚Äôs comfortable with these technologies, here‚Äôs a rough estimate:

üóìÔ∏è Estimated Timeline for a Senior Developer

Phase 1: Basic CRUD API (1-2 days)

‚úÖ Set up project structure & environment
‚úÖ Implement user authentication (JWT/OAuth)
‚úÖ Build CRUD endpoints for tasks
‚úÖ Configure PostgreSQL & database migrations

Phase 2: Authentication & User Management (1-2 days)

‚úÖ Implement user registration & login
‚úÖ Restrict tasks to be user-specific
‚úÖ Add role-based access control (optional)

Phase 3: Background Jobs & Performance Tweaks (2-3 days)

‚úÖ Set up Celery + Redis for task reminders
‚úÖ Implement caching (Redis) for optimized task retrieval
‚úÖ Optimize database queries & add indexing

Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation (1-2 days)

‚úÖ Dockerize the application
‚úÖ Write API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
‚úÖ Deploy to Render/Heroku/AWS

‚è≥ Total Estimated Time: 5-9 Days
	‚Ä¢	5-6 days if you work full-time on it
	‚Ä¢	1-2 weeks if done in spare time

In your Scalable Task Manager API, Celery can send task reminders in different ways, depending on how you want users to receive them. Here are the most common options:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Email Reminders (Most Common) üìß
	‚Ä¢ Celery sends an email notification to users when a task is overdue or due soon.
	‚Ä¢ You can use Flask-Mail or an external service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES.
